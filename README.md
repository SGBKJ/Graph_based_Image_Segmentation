Graph_based_Image_Segmentation
==============================

a computer vision project
In this project I implement and investigate Normalized cuts for image
segmentation according to Shi and Malik “Normalized Cuts and Image
Segmentation” IEEE PAMI Vol 22, No. 8..
Also, I write a matlab implementation of the
segmentation algorithm described in the paper “Efficient Graph-Based Image
Segmentation” by Pedro F. Felzenszwalb and Daniel P. Huttenlocher, published in
International Journal of Computer Vision, Volume 59, Number 2, September 2004.
